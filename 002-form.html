<!--
This is a normal HTML page, it's code it will be always the same,
it's not "dynamic" in the sense that contains no logic based on
which to show different outputs.

This page defines a form whom's target is a PHP script.

When you submit an HTML form then it's data flies with the request and
the target script can **access each form's field by name**.

Form field's "name" attribute is very important when it comes to
send some data to a PHP script.
